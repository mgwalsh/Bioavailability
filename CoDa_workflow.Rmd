# Introduction

Most empirical models of biogeography, species distributions, photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, yield, trophic dynamics, crop management and/or small area dietary requirements assume no interactions between the essential mineral nutrient elements and typically only describe the associated processes as a function of the potentially most limiting parts (i.e., [Liebig's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justus_von_Liebig)). However, *the law of the minimum* does not appear to hold consistently at plant community or ecosystem scales (see e.g., [Danger et al., 2008]( https://doi.org/10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500030040x)). In agricultural systems, the overall (multivariate) mineral nutrient composition is likely to affect both crop yields as well as the overall nutritional quality of the plant products that are subsequently consumed by animals, including humans. 

*The objective of this notebook is to provide starter code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for exploratory data analyses ([EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)) and reporting of the mineral nutrient compositions of the main cereal grains (maize, pearl-millet, rice and sorghum) that are grown in Malawi. The markdown notebook presented here is maintained on [Github](https://github.com/mgwalsh/Bioavailability/blob/master/CoDa_workflow.Rmd), and you can fork and alter it from there for your reference and as you see fit.*

*Compositional Data Analysis* (CoDA) refers to the analyses of *compositional data* (CoDa). CoDa are defined as vectors with strictly positive components whose sum is constant (e.g, 1 or 100%). The terms also cover all other *parts* of a whole (so-called *subcompositions*), which carry only relative information ([van den Boogaart and Tolosana-Delgado, 2013](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-36809-7)). Because a change in any proportion of a whole changes at least one other proportion, CoDa are interdependent. Arguably, all concentration data should be treated as CoDa because as a whole they must sum to the respective unit totals of the constituent parts e.g., in the case of plants and animals as compositions of water, organic and inorganic materials. In turn, the organic and in this case specifically the inorganic nutrient subcompositions, should also not be analyzed and interpreted without normalizing them to one another. 

The original approach to CoDA developed by [J. Aitchison (1982)](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1982.tb01195.x) uses logarithmic ratios (LRs) of the compositional parts as the fundamental starting point for CoDa description and modeling. There is also a recent CoDa review paper by [M. Greenacre (2021)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-124436) openly available, which provides excellent guidance, as well as [R scripts](https://github.com/michaelgreenacre/CODAinPractice), about the practical applications and interpretation of CoDa. There is also an open source paper available that treats genomic survey data in an analogous fashion and uses some of the graphical modeling techniques that we will be illustrating here (see [Friedman and Alm (2012)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002687), and the references therein).

# General data setup

The data we will be using were generated by the [GeoNutrition project](http://www.geonutrition.com) in Malawi. They consist of 1,808 cereal grain samples that were collected for maize (1,606), millet (31), rice (54), and sorghum (117) in proportion of their national geographical occurrence. The nationally representative cropland sampling frame and the laboratory methods that were used in the data collections are described in [Gashu et al., (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03559-3). 

The data include [ICP-MS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry) concentration measurements of the respective cereal mineral nutrient contents (in mg kg^-1^), including: Na, Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo, and I. They also include the georeference of where the samples were collected (lon/lat, EPSG:3857), the cereal crop at that location, the source of the grain samples (crop, field stack or store), if or not, fertilizer and/or lime were used in growing the crop, and basic soil properties (pH, soil organic matter and cation exchange capacity). Note that any crop nutrient measurements below their respective limits of detection (LOD) have been set to 2/3 of the respective minimum observed values. Other imputation methods are also possible in this context see [Greenacre (2021)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-124436).

## Packages and data download

To actually run this notebook, you will need to load the packages indicated in the chunk directly below to download and assemble the data. The chunk (not shown but in the markdown document) also generates an overview map of where the samples were collected in Malawi ... you can click and zoom into the individual sampling locations.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
# Package names
packages <- c("osfr", "dplyr", "leaflet", "compositions", "doParallel", "caret", "caretEnsemble", "MASS", "randomForest", "xgboost", "nnet", "stargazer", "archetypes", "arm")

# Install packages
installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())
if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
}

# Load packages
invisible(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE))
```

There will be additional packages that will be need to be installed to run the graphical models presented in a later section of this notebook, which require more customized procedures for installation depending on the R version that you are running. We'll deal with those in the relevant sections below. This next chunk downloads the Malawi data.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
# Create a data folder in your current working directory
dir.create("MW_coda", showWarnings=F)
setwd("./MW_coda")
dir.create("Results")

# Crop data download from OSF at: https://osf.io/btxyc/
osf_retrieve_file("btxyc") %>% osf_download(conflicts = "overwrite")
codat <- read.table("MW_grain_CoDa.csv", header=T, sep=",")

# Soil data download from OSF at: https://osf.io/5tgu3/
osf_retrieve_file("5tgu3") %>% osf_download(conflicts = "overwrite")
soils <- read.table("soil_props.csv", header=T, sep=",")

# Merge crop and soil data
codat <- merge(codat, soils, by = "CropSampleID")

# Download figures at: at: https://osf.io/pnw7g/
osf_retrieve_file("pnw7g") %>% osf_download(conflicts = "overwrite")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Grain sample locations
w <- leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = mean(codat$lon), lat = mean(codat$lat), zoom = 7) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap.Mapnik) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(codat$lon, codat$lat, clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
w ## plot widget 
```

## CoDa transforms

This section of the notebook sets up a CoDa data frame that includes 2 amalgamations: mineral **macro-nutrients** (i.e., Na, Mg, P, S, K, and Ca ... in atomic number order), and **micro-nutrients** (i.e., Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo, and I). Note that the distinction between *macro* and *micro* here is only intended to reflect the recommended daily dietary values ([DDV](https://www.fda.gov/food/new-nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-new-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels)) that should be consumed by people, and not their overall nutritional importance and/or benefits.

This next chunk [closes](https://econ-papers.upf.edu/papers/1554.pdf) the CoDa, and calculates *centered logratios* ([CLR](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/compositions/versions/2.0-1/topics/clr)). These can then be analyzed, summarized and interpreted with conventional univariate, multivariate, and data modeling methods ([Greenacre, 2021](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-124436)). Note that you could also use other logratios such as the [ALR](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/compositions/versions/2.0-1/topics/alr), or the [ILR](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/compositions/versions/2.0-1/topics/ilr) and/or different amalgamations of subcompositions, but we shall leave those possibilities for you to explore. We also write out the resulting data frame to your `./MW_coda/Results` directory should you wish to process it in software other than R.

```{r}
# Calculate the CLRs
varc <- c("Na", "Mg", "P", "S", "K", "Ca", "Cr", "Mn", "Fe", "Co", "Cu", "Zn", "Se", "Mo", "I")
combo <- codat[varc]
combo <- combo / rowSums(combo) ## close the composition
combo <- as.data.frame(clr(combo)) ## centered log ratio (clr) transform

# Define the (macro / micro) amalgamation and add it to the overall nutrient composition
varm <- c("Na", "Mg", "P", "S", "K", "Ca")
macro <- rowSums(combo[varm])
combo <- cbind(combo, macro)

# Attach site data info
locv <- c("CropSampleID", "SoilSampleID", "lat", "lon", "crop", "source", "fert", "pH", "soc", "eCEC") 
locs <- codat[locv]
site <- cbind(locs, combo)

# Write file
write.csv(site, "./MW_coda/Results/MW_site_coda.csv", row.names = F)
```

You can plot raw CLR differences between crop species with something like in this next ugly chunk ...

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.show = 'hold', fig.height = 12, fig.width = 7.2, fig.cap = "Boxplots of nutrient CLR differences between crop species."}

par(mfrow = c(5,3), pty="s", mar=c(2,4,1,1))
boxplot(site$Na ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Na", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$Mg ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Mg", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$P ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "P", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$S ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "S", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$K ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "K", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$Ca ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Ca", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$Cr ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Cr", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$Mn ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Mn", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$Fe ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Fe", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$Co ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Co", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$Cu ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Cu", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$Zn ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Zn", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$Se ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Se", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$Mo ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "Mo", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
boxplot(site$I ~ site$crop, notch = T, ylab = "I", xlab = "", cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1.3)
```

# Compositional archetypes and classification

*Archetypal analysis* ([Cutler and Breiman, 1994](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/technometrics/90-00/vol-36-04/v3604338.pdf)) is an unsupervised learning method similar to e.g., [K-means clustering](https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-explained-4528df86a120). It describes each observation in a dataset as a mixture of archetypes. Rather than describing average or typical observations and measurements, archetypal analysis seeks to identify extreme points on the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of a data matrix, which can provide a simple and quite useful way of clustering and looking at multivariate data ([Eugster and Leisch, 2009](https://cran.r-project.org/web//packages/archetypes/vignettes/archetypes.pdf)). The identified archetypes themselves are mixtures of the individual variables under consideration. Archetypal mixture coefficients and projections are also CoDa, which is why we include them in this notebook. Note that other clustering and ordination algorithms could also be used in this context ([Greenacre, 2021](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-124436)) .

## Identifying archetypes

This next chunk fits the Malawi CLR data using the [`archetypes`](https://cran.r-project.org/web//packages/archetypes/vignettes/archetypes.pdf) package, which is a robust implementation of the original Cutler and Breiman (1994) algorithm that uses [k-fold validation](https://www.statology.org/k-fold-cross-validation/)

```{r, output = 'hide'}
# Fit nutrient archetypes with 10-fold cross validation
set.seed(85321)
comp.arc <- stepArchetypes(data=site[,8:22], k = 1:10, nrep = 10, verbose = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4, fig.cap = "Archetype scree-plot showing the no. of archetypes vs the multivariate residual sums of squares (RSS)."}

par(pty="s", mar=c(4,4,1,1))
screeplot(comp.arc)
```

## Archetypal classification

Similar to other clustering and ordination algorithms, we can use the identified archetypes for dimensional reduction and unsupervised classification.

```{r}
# Select no. of archetypes, the scree plot above suggests 3-7 ... we use 4 here
comp.arc3 <- bestModel(comp.arc[[4]])

# Classify CLRs by "dominant archetypes" (DA)
darc <- as.data.frame(predict(comp.arc4, site[,8:22]))
darc$DA <- as.factor(apply(darc, 1, which.max))
colnames(darc) <- c("A1","A2","A3","DA")
site <- cbind(site, darc)

# Overwrite the site file
write.csv(site, "./MW_coda/Results/MW_site_coda.csv", row.names = F)
```

This is an aside, but it gives you an idea of what the "*most*" dominant archetypal sites look like from a [GeoSurvey](https://osf.io/vxc97/) perspective in Malawi. This should remind us of the fact that there are probably quite explicit spatial links to assessing nutrient compositions that could be explored. However, those links are certainly not plainly visible in satellite images, without significant ground data collection support.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Dominant archetypal grain nutrient composition sites in Malawi visualized in GeoSurvey.", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./MW_coda/MW_archetypes.png")
```

# Sample provenance tagging and tracking

The main reason for including this section is that where and from which sources the grain samples were obtained i.e., their *"provenance"*, could make a difference as to how those data should be used and interpreted for diagnostics. In this dataset the grain samples were collected either directly from the standing crop, from harvested crop stacks in the field, or from household grain stores on both fertilized and unfertilized fields. Both household grain stores and fertilized fields are more problematic in this context in that we don't actually know what happened after samples were removed from the field and stored and/or what the actual effect of the amounts of fertilizer and/or lime that were used are. However, the combination of these factors could influence the reported survey results e.g., via soil contamination of the obtained grain samples and/or any other overall sample treatment differences.

## Sample provenance tagging

The next chunks provides an example of sample provenance tagging and tracking. We differentiate reference samples that were obtained from field (crop or stack) on unfertilized fields, from all of the other survey samples (i.e., stored and/or fertilized background samples). Note that you can easily change and/or expand the rule(s) for this. However you define "reference samples", these should be your highest-value targets in future surveys because they define a consistent baseline for monitoring diagnostic changes. Note that these are hard to collect in the field because they have to be sampled during a quite narrow time window during a given cropping season.

```{r}
# Tag reference samples with <dplyr>
rsite <- site %>% mutate(ref = case_when(source == 'crop' | source == 'stack' & fert == 'n' ~ 'y',
                         TRUE ~ 'n'))

# Reference sample/site file write out
write.csv(rsite, "./MW_coda/Results/MW_ref_coda.csv", row.names = F)

# Reference sample location map
rloc <- rsite[ which(rsite$ref == 'y'), ]

r <- leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = mean(rloc$lon), lat = mean(rloc$lat), zoom = 7) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap.Mapnik) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(rloc$lon, rloc$lat, clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
r ## plot widget 
```

## Sample provenance tracking

You could track and monitor your reference samples with the following short, exploratory machine learning workflow. We initially split the data into calibration and validation sets and select the relevant features for distinguishing between reference and other samples.

```{r}
# Set calibration/validation set randomization seed
seed <- 123581
set.seed(seed)

# Split data into calibration and validation sets
gsIndex <- createDataPartition(rsite$ref, p = 4/5, list = F, times = 1)
gs_cal <- rsite[ gsIndex,]
gs_val <- rsite[-gsIndex,]

# Specify sample calibration labels
labs <- c("ref")
lcal <- as.vector(t(gs_cal[labs]))

# Specify calibration features
fcal <- gs_cal[ ,c(3:4,8:22)] ## selects lat/lon & CoDa features
```

The following `caretEnsemble` chunk then generates the reference sample / site predictions on the validation set with default-tuning of the relevant [hyperparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)). Note that if you would like more control over the individual model fits, you can also use their respective `tuneList` arguments.

```{r, warning = FALSE, results='hide'}
# Start doParallel to parallelize model fitting
seed <- 123581
set.seed(seed)
mc <- makeCluster(detectCores())
registerDoParallel(mc)

# Specify model training controls
tc <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, classProbs = T,
                   summaryFunction = twoClassSummary, allowParallel = TRUE,
                   savePredictions = "final")

# Fit 5 calibration models using all of the CoDa features
clist <- caretList(fcal, lcal,
                   trControl = tc,
                   tuneList = NULL,
                   methodList = c("glmStepAIC", "rf", "xgbTree", "nnet", "nb"),
                   metric = "ROC")

gs_val$gl <- predict(clist$glmStepAIC, gs_val, type = 'prob')$y
gs_val$rf <- predict(clist$rf, gs_val, type = 'prob')$y
gs_val$xt <- predict(clist$xgbTree, gs_val, type = 'prob')$y
gs_val$nn <- predict(clist$nnet, gs_val, type = 'prob')$y
gs_val$nb <- predict(clist$nb, gs_val, type = 'prob')$y
stopCluster(mc)
fname <- paste("./MW_coda/Results/", labs, "_clist.rds", sep = "")
saveRDS(clist, fname)
```

The next chunk then stacks the 5 previous models (or "base learners") on the validation set. We will use `glmStepAIC` function for this, but you might want to try other "top learners" in this context as well.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
# Set validation labels and features
lval <- as.vector(t(gs_val[labs])) ##  subset validation labels
fval <- gs_val[ ,28:32] ## subset validation features

# Start doParallel to parallelize model fitting
mc <- makeCluster(detectCores())
registerDoParallel(mc)

# Control setup
set.seed(1385321)
tc <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, classProbs = T,
                   summaryFunction = twoClassSummary, allowParallel = TRUE,
                   savePredictions = "final")

# Model training
st <- train(fval, lval,
            method = "glmStepAIC",
            family = "binomial",
            metric = "ROC",
            trControl = tc)

# Model outputs & predictions
gs_val$st <- predict(st, gs_val, type = 'prob')$y ## stacked predictions on validation set
stopCluster(mc)
fname <- paste("./MW_coda/Results/", labs, "_st.rds", sep = "")
saveRDS(st, fname)
```

# Survey post-stratification

This section provides initial data model summaries of parts of the CLR transformed data. We focus on the contrast of the macro / micro nutrient subcompositions between crops by predicted provenance. This can be readily extended to other compositional amalgamations. These next chunks fit the differences between the individual macro nutrient CLRs of millet, rice and sorghum as compared to maize, post-stratified on sample provenance. We will be doing this using mixed-effects regression with the [`arm`]() package.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
# Fit nutrients by crop species with mixed-effects regression
m1 <- lmer(Na~crop + (1|ref), data = rsite)
m2 <- lmer(Mg~crop + (1|ref), data = rsite)
m3 <- lmer(P~crop, data = rsite)
m4 <- lmer(S~crop, data = rsite)
m5 <- lmer(K~crop, data = rsite)
m6 <- lmer(Ca~crop, data = rsite)

# Generate regression summary table
stargazer::stargazer(m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, type = "html", 
                     ci = TRUE, ci.level = 0.95, intercept.bottom = FALSE, digits = 1, 
                     omit.table.layout = "sn", model.numbers = FALSE,
                     column.sep.width = "24pt",
                     covariate.labels = c("Intercept","millet","rice","sorghum"),
                     title = "Macro-nutrient regression summary using maize as the reference crop.")
```
\

Based on this, there appear to be clear differences between the macro compositional parts of the 4 cereal crops. Maize appears to have a higher macro-nutrient proportion than millet, rice or sorghum. Conversely, because of the binary macro / micro contrast that is imposed here, the proportion of total micro-minerals would be expected to be proportionally higher in millet, rice and sorghum as compared to maize. The corresponding micro-nutrient summary is shown in the table below.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
# Fit macro-nutrients by crop species and fertilizer use
m7 <- rq(Cr~crop, data = site)
m8 <- rq(Mn~crop, data = site)
m9 <- rq(Fe~crop, data = site)
m10 <- rq(Co~crop, data = site)
m11 <- rq(Cu~crop, data = site)
m12 <- rq(Zn~crop, data = site)
m13 <- rq(Se~crop, data = site)
m14 <- rq(Mo~crop, data = site)
m15 <- rq(I~crop, data = site)

# Generate regression summary table
stargazer::stargazer(m7, m8, m9, m10, m11, m12, m13, m14, m15, type = "html", 
                     ci = TRUE, ci.level = 0.95, intercept.bottom = FALSE, digits = 1, 
                     omit.table.layout = "sn", model.numbers = FALSE,
                     column.sep.width = "24pt",
                     covariate.labels = c("Intercept","millet","rice","sorghum"),
                     title = "Micro-nutrient regression summary using maize as the reference crop.")
```

# Graphical models of nutrient interactions

So far, we have largely been dealing with univariate CoDa models, as is common practice. The aim of this next section is to illustrate an empirical multivariate basis that describes the relevant conditional relationships between the different CoDa parts with graphical interaction models. The types of models that we will be using are well described and illustrated in [H√∏jsgaard, Edwards and Lauritzen (2012)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-2299-0) including the code and references therein. There is also an open R tutorial by [H√∏jsgaard (2012)](https://people.math.aau.dk/~sorenh/misc/2012-Oslo-GMwR/GMwR-notes.pdf) available, which you might want to consult.

## Package installs

To run this section of the notebook you will initially need to install the relevant packages. This is a bit of an art form depending on the version of R that you are currently running. Both the [`gRim`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gRim/index.html) and [`statnet`](https://statnet.org/) packages that we shall be using for these analyses and their visualization have dependencies to other packages e.g., [`bioconductor`](http://www.bioconductor.org/install/), which can be a bit tricky depending on their versioning cycle on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). The next chunks are what worked for us using our current `R.Version()`, but this is likely to change and you may need to adjust accordingly depending on your setup.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
# Install <bioconductor> first ... see: http://www.bioconductor.org/install/
# do this only once
# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#    install.packages("BiocManager")
# BiocManager::install(version = "3.13")

# note that this will query you in the console as to whether to update other associated packages ... (a/s/n). Reply with n if all of the listed packages are up to date.

# Then install and load gRbase, gRim and statnet 
packages <- c("gRbase", "gRim", "statnet")

# Install packages
installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())
if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
}

# Load packages
invisible(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE))
```

Similarly, the [`statnet`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/statnet/versions/2019.6) package, which we will use for graphical model visualization currently may have some specific installation requirements that you can track on their [Github repository](https://statnet.org/).

## Fitting graphical interaction models

The first graphical model that we fit provides a baseline for describing nutrient interactions by crop species. We start with a model that initially contains no interactions and then adds only the most significant ones sequentially (i.e., with [Foward selection](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume20/17-334/17-334.pdf)).

```{r, results = 'hide'}
# CoDa interactions by crop type
coda <- site[ ,c(5,8:22)]

# Forward selection
mm1 <- mmod(~.^1, data = coda)
mm2 <- forward(mm1)
mmf2 <- ugList(terms(mm2), result="matrix")
net <- as.network(x = mmf2, directed = FALSE, loops = FALSE, matrix.type = "adjacency")
```

This next chunk produces the associated interaction graph.

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4, fig.cap = "Baseline CoDa nutrient interaction graph by crop species."}

par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
plot.network(net, vertex.col = "light grey", vertex.cex = 6, displaylabels = T, label.pos = 5, mode = "circle")
```

You can also obtain the [Maximal cliques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/maximal-clique) of this graph. In [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and in statistics, a clique is a complete subset of a graph, and a maximal clique is a clique which cannot be enlarged. In this particular case, *"maximal cliques"* can be interpreted as specific grain nutrient subcompositions that may warrant further exploration for any subsequent diagnostic modeling.

```{r}
getCliques(mmf2)
```

We can fit a similar model by separating the interactions by macro and micro-nutrient subcompositions, by crop species. The `mm3` base model specification sets that up. We can then use [Backward selection](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume20/17-334/17-334.pdf) to retain only the most significant interactions in the corresponding `mm4` fit, which also produces the associated graph.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
# Marco and micro-nutrient interactions by crop type
mm3 <- mmod(~crop:Na:Mg:P:S:K:Ca+crop:Cr:Mn:Fe:Co:Cu:Zn:Se:Mo:I, data = coda)
mm4 <- backward(mm3)
mmf4 <- ugList(terms(mm4), result="matrix")
net <- as.network(x = mmf4, directed = FALSE, loops = FALSE, matrix.type = "adjacency")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4, fig.cap = "CoDa macro and micro-nutrient interaction graph by crop species."}

par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
plot.network(net, vertex.col = "light grey", vertex.cex = 6, displaylabels = T, label.pos = 5, mode = "circle")
```

Under the given model assumptions, the corresponding maximal cliques (subcompositions) are identified as:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
getCliques(mmf4)
```

Note that this halves the number of subcompositions that might need to be considered relative to the baseline (`m2`) model, and therefore could be considered as a minimal CoDa interaction model relative to the main cereal crop species that are reported in Malawi.

# Takeways

The main takeaways from this notebook are the following:

* Converting nutrient concentrations to multivariate logratios is a simple step, but unlike other data transformations it preserves the integrity of the relevant compositional parts that are needed to normalize the data for most subsequent univariate, multivariate and/or inferential analyses and the associated statistics. Also, CoDA estimates can always be back-transformed into their original units given total concentration sums.

* We think that it may be more informative to analyze mineral nutrient concentration data as CoDa. The associated LR conversions (ALR, CLR, ILR) do not make the data any more computationally difficult or time consuming, but they should improve any subsequent data modeling, geostatistical and/or machine learning based predictions in instances where subcompositional closure principles (*sensu* [Aitchison geometry](https://laboratoriomatematicas.uniandes.edu.co/cursocoda/04-Vera-geometry.pdf)) apply.

* Clustering the CoDa nutrient data in fewer dimensions, e.g., via archetypal analysis, provides a simple framework and generalization for post-stratifying nutrient survey results that should improve the precision and accuracy of national cereal grain mineral nutrient estimates in Malawi. Other clustering and [Ordination techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination_(statistics)) could / should also be explored in this context (see [Greenacre, 2021](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-124436)).

* Reference sample tagging and tracking can help with locating where and under what circumstances the CoDa were obtained and identifies high value targets for future surveys. This also broaches the subject of generating deployment-ready, spectral and/or spatial nutrient predictions using machine learning and/or geostatistics. These additional topics will be covered in more detail in subsequent notebooks.

* Graphical interaction models help to clarify the conditional relationships between compositional parts. They can also be used to select, model and compare different subcompositions, including those guided by domain experts. This is **our preferred EDA technique** for developing e.g., reproducible soil and/or spatial diagnostics of potential nutrient deficiencies ... data permitting.
